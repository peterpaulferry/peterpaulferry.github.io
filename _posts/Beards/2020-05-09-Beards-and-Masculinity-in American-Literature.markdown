 Beards and Masculinity in American Literature is a pioneering study of the symbolic power of the beard in the history of American writing. This book covers the entire breadth of the American literary tradition—from 18th- century American newspapers and periodicals through the 19th and 20th centuries to recent contemporary engagements with the beard and masculinity. With chapters focused on the barber and the barbershop in American writing, the “need for a shave” in Ernest Hemingway’s fiction, Walt Whitman’s beard as a sanctuary for poets reaching out to the bearded bard, and the contemporary reengagement with the beard as a symbol of Otherness in post- 9/11 fiction, Beards and Masculinity in American Literature underlines the symbolic power of facial hair in key works of American writing.
