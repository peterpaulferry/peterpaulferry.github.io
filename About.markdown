I am Associate Professor of English at the University of Stavanger, Norway, where I teach 19th, 20th, and 21st Century Literature. My latest book is [*Beards and Masculinity in American Literature* (Routledge 2020)](https://www.routledge.com/Beards-and-Masculinity-in-American-Literature/Ferry/p/book/9781138093768). My previous book was [*Masculinity in Contemporary New York Fiction* (Routledge 2015)](https://www.routledge.com/Masculinity-in-Contemporary-New-York-Fiction/Ferry/p/book/9781138382893).

I am currently writing my first novel. It tells the stories of the women of the North who lived through the era of the workhouse and the laundry.
