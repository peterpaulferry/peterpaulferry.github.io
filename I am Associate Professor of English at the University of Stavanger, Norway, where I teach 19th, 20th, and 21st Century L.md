I am Associate Professor of English at the University of Stavanger, Norway, where I teach 19th, 20th, and 21st Century Literature. My latest book is *Beards and Masculinity in American Literature* (Routledge 2020). My previous book was *Masculinity in Contemporary New York Fiction* (Routledge 2015). I continue publishing my research on gender and masculinity in American Literature alongside a continuing curiosity in the flaneur in American writing.
